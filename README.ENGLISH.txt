
====== War3Source (W3S) ======

War3Source  brings the Warcraft 3 leveling style and races into the game.
It is originally based on the amxmodx (AMX) version War3FT.

Each standard race has total of 16 levels, made up of 3 skills and 1 ultimate 
where each skill/ultimate can be leveled 4 times for a total of 16 levels.

War3Source features a modular design where races can be coded independently and loaded into the main plugin.
Independent plugins (Addons) can be created to complement or change aspects War3Source.

There are also items in W3S as there are in all Warcraft mods.

War3Source is written in SourcePawn under the SourceMod extension.

War3Source is not WCS (warcraft-source), and we ask that you do not call it 
or refer to it as WCS (or even just "warcraft source") for any reason. 
W3S and WCS are similar such as they can feature the same races and they bring forth the same style of gameplay, 
but they are two completely different projects.
War3Source offerers unbeatable performance and quality under SourcePawn and involves more interaction between races,
and has a buff/debuff system where races are expected to respect other race's buffs and debuffs.

W3S came first to the source engine, WCS came later but matured faster under the nature of ES/Python prototyping 
languages but is limited in performance and features compared to W3S. 

W3S was originally founded by Anthony Iacono (AKA "pimpinjuice") and is also the founder of superhero mod (SH).
Yi (Derek) Luo AKA Ownage | Ownz (DarkEnergy) is the second developer of War3Source 
and took over primary develpement after march 2010.


========= SuperHero Source (SH)========

SuperHero Source  runs on top of war3source, uses its powerful engines and interfaces.

Superhero Source is a modification for the popular Game Counter Strike Source
and is made after the successfull Superhero Mod from Counter Strike 1.6.
The point is to Kill other Players and gain Experience from that. When you reach a certain amount of Experience you get a Level Up.
Each Level Up allows you to Pick one additional Hero to your Arsenal.
Each Hero possesses a unique Power, enabling you to do unbelievable stuff, which may seem to be cheats or hacks first, but they are not!
But remember: You are not alone with those Powers!


See installation and follow directions on how to run SuperHero Source mode.
